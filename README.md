# A simple naive Markdown compiler in Rust
 \- Ben Beshara, 2023
 
This is a contrived demo designed for me to learn more about writing applications in Rust. There is a rust markdown library, use that, this is just a learning exercise.

It can read in either a single file or a directory of files, and outputs the contents as HTML to the specified file or directory.

USAGE:

markd \<input file or directory\> \<output file or directory\>
